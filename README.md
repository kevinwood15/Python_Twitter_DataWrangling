# Python_Twitter_DataWrangling
The main objectives of this project is to wrangle (clean) and analyze twitter data. I deal with some messy data, clean it, then plot some visualizations of the data to analyze it. 
This project utilizes three data type:
The .csv file is of tweets from twitter (now X), which post pictures of dogs and rate them on a scale of 10
The .tsv is data from an algorithm that predictions the dogs breed from an image
The .json file provides additional information about each posts number of retweets, favorites, etc.
